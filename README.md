# Descriptive and Predictive Analytics

Welcome! This repository provides simple examples, code, and notes about analyzing data using both descriptive and predictive techniques.

## What’s Inside?

- **A Jupyter Notebook Project:** Step-by-step tutorial for exploring and modeling data, using a real example dataset.
- **Scripts:** Python code for cleaning data, creating charts, and building a basic machine learning model.
- **Data:** One sample dataset for practice.

## About the Project

The main project in this repository walks you through a complete workflow:
- **Loading and cleaning a dataset**
- **Exploring summary statistics and visualizations**
- **Building a basic predictive model to make predictions from the data**

This is a beginner-friendly example, so you can follow along and learn the basics of descriptive and predictive analytics using Python.
